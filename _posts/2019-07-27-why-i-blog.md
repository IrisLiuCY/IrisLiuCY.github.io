First of all, I was a software engineer for almost 2 years. And yes, I have a blog now. But this post is by no mean to say that I am a successful software engineer, given the definition of success varies.

I truly think that writing is a natural thing for the successful software engineers. Perhaps, writing makes them more successful if they haven't start writing.

### Here is why:
1. Blog is where you consolidate and share your ideas and learning outcomes
2. You may connect and collaborate with other amazing software developers
3. Your friends, colleagues and (future) bosses will see your blog
4. 20% of time as a software engineer is spent on writing

### Blog as a platform to consolidate and share your ideas and learning outcomes

A big part of being a software engineer is to constantly learn - whether to learn the latest technology or to update the knowledge base. Blog is a great place to update and summarize the learning progress.

The idea of starting a personal blog has been swirling around my head for some time, and I think the best way to shut it down is to create one.

### There are a few things that you should know up-front:
1. Ghost is designed for ambitious, professional publishers who want to actively build a business around their content. That's who it works best for. If you're using Ghost for some other purpose, that's fine too - but it might not be the best choice for you.
2. The entire platform can be modified and customized to suit your needs, which is very powerful, but doing so **does** require some knowledge of code. Ghost is not necessarily a good platform for beginners or people who just want a simple personal blog.
3. For the best experience we recommend downloading the Ghost Desktop App for your computer, which is the best way to access your Ghost site on a desktop device.


Ghost is made by an independent non-profit organisation called the Ghost Foundation. We are 100% self funded by revenue from our [Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing) service, and every penny we make is re-invested into funding further development of free, open source technology for modern journalism.

The main thing you'll want to read about next is probably: [the Ghost editor](https://demo.ghost.io/the-editor/).

Once you're done reading, you can simply delete the default **Ghost** user from your team to remove all of these introductory posts! -->
